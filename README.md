# webpack-yarn-boilerplate

Basic webpack setup for kicking off development quickly.

Babel for JS and SASS compiles, and gets processed by PostCSS.

Edit the following files to tune this jump starter for your needs:

* `.babelrc` to tune your JS for older or newer browsers
* `.eslintrc` to get yelled at as much or as little as you like by the linter
* `postcss.config.js` to tune your autoprefixing and other postcss features.

### Getting Started

Run `yarn`.

Then fire up the dev server: `npm start`.
